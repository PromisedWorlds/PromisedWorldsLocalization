Translation Guidelines:
- Translations should be grammatically correct and use proper punctuation and capitalization.
- Please be serious in translation - no jokes / easter eggs. Users should have as close to the same experience as possible, regardless of what language they play.
- Be mindful of sensitivities - keep translations PG and avoid swearing / offensive language.
- Try to stick to the meaning and tone of the original English writing where possible.
- If you have an issue, such as a word that you can't translate, or need help, contact me @levitato on Discord
- Jokes are also hard to translate - a literal translation of the English text may not be funny in your language! I will work with you for that, where there are jokes in the English text.
- Please be open to criticism and review from other translators - we want to make sure all translations are as high quality as possible, which means checking each other's work for mistakes - we all make them!
- Likewise, please review other translators' work in the same language, and offer helpful and constructive criticism.

Thank you all for helping to translate Promised Worlds!
